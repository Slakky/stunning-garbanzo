# Expression analysis

First I will merge all the `.bam` files generated into one file for each condition. In order to do so I will use `samtools merge`. Since the bam files are already sorted, this shouldn't take much time. 

Okay, so I am not going to merge the reads because they are biological replicates and I want to keep them separate. A reason for that is the posterior statistical analysis. 

So now I can identify transcriptional units. For that I can use IGV and load both the`.gtf` annotation file and the `.bam` file.
