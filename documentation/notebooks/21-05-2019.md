Today I'm going to do the read count of the transcripts from Tn-seq. For that I've ran `HTseq` like follows:
```bash
cd /home/clno2215/stunning-garbanzo/results/transcriptomics/Tn-seq/BWT2
for i in *.bam
do htseq-count $i /home/clno2215/stunning-garbanzo/results/genomics/prokka_annotation/PROKKA_04292019.gtf -f bam -t CDS > $HTSeq$i.count
done
```
Meanwhile I've analyzed the probable antibiotic resistance genes present on the assembly. For that I've used `ABRicator` that BLASTS the contigs against selected nucleotide databases containing typical antibiotic resistance genes, the one I used is `resfinder`. 

the command is pretty simple

```bash
abricator *.fasta > output.tab
```
