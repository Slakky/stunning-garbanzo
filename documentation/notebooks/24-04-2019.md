Now we have to do the synteny analysis, for that we can use [`SynChro`](http://www.lcqb.upmc.fr/CHROnicle/SynChro.html). 

To run this program we need the annotation files for both a reference genome and our assembly. For the closely related genome I chose *Enterococcus casseliflavus*. I downloaded both the assembly and the annotation in `.gbk` format. 

After setting up the program (read the documentation for more information on how to do so) we transform our `.gbk` files into the specific format that SynChro requires, in order to do that we can run:

```bash
./ConvertGbk.py Enteroccocus Casseliflavus ECLA
./ConvertGbk.py Enteroccocus Faecium EFAE
```

 Well, it seems like the conversion is not supported anymore and does not work with current gbk formats. 



TODAY I LOST THE WHOLE DAY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT SYNTENY IS
